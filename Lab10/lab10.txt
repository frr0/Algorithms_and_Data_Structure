Exercise 01
-----------

Use the graph library included in
lab09-GraphLibrary
to solve the Hamilton's path or the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP).

Definition of an Hamilton's path:
Given an undirected graph G =(V, E) and two of its nodes v and w,
an Hamilton's path, it is exists, is a simple path that connects v and
w and visits each node of the graph once and just once.
If v coincides with w, the Hamilton's path is a cycle (Hamilton's cycle).

Write a function that:
- Receives an undirected and unweighted graph, and the identifiers
  of one vertex of the graph
- It computes and prints-out an Hamilton's cycle (if it exists).

Example.
Given the graph

A ----- B
|       |
|       |
|       |
C ----- D

If we start from A a Hamilton's cycle is A, B, C, D.



Exercise 02
-----------

Use the graph library included in
lab09-GraphLibrary
to solve the Euler's path problem

Definition of an Euler's path:
Given an undirected graph G =(V, E) and two of its nodes v and w,
an Euler's path is a path, if it exists (may be non simple), that
connects u and v and crosses each edge once and only once.
If v coincides with w, the Euler's path is a cycle (Euler's cycle).

Write a function that:
- Receives an undirected and unweighted graph, and the identifiers
  of one vertex of the graph
- It computes and prints-out an Euler's cycle (if it exists).

Example.
Given the graph

A ----- B
|       |
|       |
|       |
C ----- D

If we start from A a Euler's cycle is A, B, C, D, A.



Exercise 03
-----------

Use the graph library included in
lab09-GraphLibrary
to solve the following problem.

Suppose to use the library to read an undirected, unweighted
and connected graph.

Write a function able to delete the minimum number of edges such
that the resulting graph is no more connected.

Example.
Given the graph

A ----- B
|       |
|       |
|       |
C ----- D

if we just erase one edge the graph remain connected, whereas
if we erase edges:
- AB and BD
- AB and CD
- ...
the graph become unconnected.



Exercise 04
-----------

Use the graph library included in
lab09-GraphLibrary
to solve the same problem analyzed in Exercise 03, but the two
unconnected component have to include a number of vertices that
differ at most by 1.

Example.
Given the graph

A ----- B
|       |
|       |
|       |
C ----- D

if we erase edges
AB and BD
we have one connected component of 1 node (B) and one of 3 nodes (A, C, and D).

On the contrary, if we erase edges
AB and CD
we have two connected component of exactly 2 nodes.
