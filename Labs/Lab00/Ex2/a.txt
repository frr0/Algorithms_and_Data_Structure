-----------

A file defines a set of rectangles with the following format:
* Each row of the file contains 1 string and 2 real numbers:
  - The string (4 character long) is the rectangle identifier,
  - The two numbers specifies the x and y coordinates,
    respectively, of one of its vertices
* For each rectangle there are two lines in the file, specifying
  the coordinate of two opposite vertices (top-right and
  bottom-left or top-left and bottom-right).
  Notice that, in general, the two rows defining a rectangle are
  not consecutive, and that it is not known which vertex they
  specify.
In any case, suppose the maximum number of rectangles is 100.

Write a C program that receives 3 file names on the command line:
- The first file is an input file, and it contains all rectangles
  specifications as previously indicated
- The second file is an output file, and it must contain the
  name of the rectangles ordered by ascending area values.
- The third file is an output file, and it must contain the
  name of the rectangles ordered by ascending perimeter values.

Suggestion
----------

Use an array of structures where each element on the array stores
the name and the two extreme coordinates.

Example
-------

Let us suppose that the program receives the following three parameters:
fileIn.txt fileArea.txt filePerimeter.txt


rct2  1.5 3.5
xxyy  -0.5 3.0
xxyy  1.5 2.0
abcd  1.0 4.5
ktkr  -2.5 1.5
abcd  2.0 2.0
rct2  3.5 -2.0
trya  2.5 -1.0
ktkr  1.5 3.5
trya  4.0 4.0

As areas and perimeters of the rectangles are:
rct2   area=11.00   perimeter=15.00
xxyy   area= 2.00   perimeter= 6.00
abcd   area= 2.50   perimeter= 7.00
ktkr   area= 8.00   perimeter=12.00
trya   area= 7.50   perimeter=13.00
the program has to generate the following two files:

fileArea.txt:
rct2
ktkr
trya
abcd
xxyy

filePerimeter.txt:
rct2
trya
ktkr
abcd
xxyy
